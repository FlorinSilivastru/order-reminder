Inventory Prediction &amp; Notification System

Description:
A web-based system for retailers to manage cosmetic inventory. The system predicts when a customer‚Äôs products will run out based on average usage and sends manager notifications and customer email reminders, optionally offering discounts. The application is built using a microservice architecture, leveraging a service bus for asynchronous communication.

üß© Functional Requirements
1. Authentication & Authorization Service
User registration (admin adds retailers)

  JWT-based login
  
  Role-based access: Admin, Retailer
  
  User management (for Admin only)

  Product name
  
  Brand
  
  Initial quantity
  
  Current quantity
  
  Avg daily usage
  
  Customer email
  
  Last updated date
  
  Assign products to a retailer

3. Usage & Prediction Service
  Background job (runs daily)
  
  Calculates predicted depletion date = Current Quantity / Avg Daily Usage
  
  Emits ProductDepletionPredictedEvent when product is expected to run out within threshold (e.g., 5 days)
  
  Rules engine for business logic (e.g., buffer days, min stock levels)

4. Notification Service
  Listens to ProductDepletionPredictedEvent

  Sends email to:
  
  Retailer (with product info, customer email, prediction)
  
  Customer (reminder + optional discount offer)
  
  Uses a simple SMTP or dummy email interface (plug-in ready for SendGrid)

5. Admin Analytics Service
Tracks:

  Most used products
  
  Avg depletion times
  
  Customers likely to reorder
  
  Dashboard API for charts and data visualization
